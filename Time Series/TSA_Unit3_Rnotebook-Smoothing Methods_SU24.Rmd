This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Compare holt-winter to regression-based model and seasonal naive method
```{r}

#### Figure 18.5
library(forecast)
# run Holt-Winters exponential smoothing
# use ets() with option model = "MAA" to fit Holt-Winter's exponential smoothing 
# with multiplicative error, additive trend, and additive seasonality. 
hwin <- ets(train.ts, model = "MAA")

# create predictions
hwin.pred <- forecast(hwin, h = nValid, level = 0)

# plot the series
plot(hwin.pred, ylim = c(1300, 2600),  ylab = "Ridership", xlab = "Time", 
     bty = "l", xaxt = "n", main = "", flty = 2)
##try to add ', include =nValid + 12' to the end

axis(1, at = seq(1991, 2006, 1), labels = format(seq(1991, 2006, 1)))
#lines(hwin.pred$fitted, lwd = 2, col = "blue")
lines(valid.ts)


# fit regression model with polynomial trend and seasonality
train.lm.trend.season <- tslm(train.ts ~ trend + I(trend^2) + season)
train.lm.trend.season.pred <- forecast(train.lm.trend.season, h= nValid, level = 0)
lines(train.lm.trend.season.pred$mean, col = 'red')

#Revisit seasonal naive
snaive.pred <- snaive(train.ts, h = nValid) #seasonal naive method: an approach that uses the most recent period in the previous

###Practice Problems####
Problem 17.3 Toys "R" Us Revenues. Figure 17.13 is a time plot of the 
quarterly revenues of Toys "R" Us between 1992 and 1995 (thanks to Chris 
Albright for suggesting the use of these data, which are available in
ToysRUsRevenues.csv). 

```{r}
#load the data and create time series object
library(readxl)
tru.data <- read_excel("ToysRUsRevenues.xls")
#tru.data <- read.csv("ToysRUsRevenues.csv")
head(tru.data) #see data
dim(tru.data)
tru.ts <- ts(tru.data[, 2], start = c(1992, 1), end = c(1995, 4), freq = 4)
plot(tru.ts,  ylab = "Revenue ($ millions)", xlab = "Time", bty = "l", 
     xlim = c(1992,1996), ylim = c(0,4500),main = "")

```

a) Partition the data: validation set contains the last four quarters. Use everything else as the training set.  
```{r}
nValid <- 4
nTrain <- length(tru.ts) - nValid
train.ts <-window(tru.ts,start = c(1992,1), end = c(1992,nTrain))
valid.ts <-window(tru.ts,start = c(1992,nTrain+1), end = c(1992,nTrain+nValid))
tail(train.ts)
head(valid.ts)

```

b) Fit a regression model with a linear trend and additive seasonality on the training set. Then find the forecast on the validatio set.
```{r}
library(forecast)
train.lm.trend.season <- tslm(train.ts ~ trend + season)
train.lm.trend.season.pred <- forecast(train.lm.trend.season, h=nValid, level = 0)
head(train.lm.trend.season.pred$mean)

```


c) Fit a holt-winter method on the training set. Use ets() function to determine the specific argument. Then find the forecasts on the validation set.
```{r}
train.hwin <- ets(train.ts, model = "MAA")
train.hwin.pred <- forecast(train.hwin, h = nValid, level = 0)
head(train.hwin.pred)
```

d) Build an ARIMA model on the training set and find the forecast on the validation set. We'll learn this next week.
```{r}
train.arima <- #Fill your codes here
train.arima.pred <- #Fill your codes here  
```



e) Fit a seasonal naive method on the training set and compute the forecast values on the validtion set.
```{r}
snaive.pred <- snaive(train.ts, h= nValid)
head(snaive.pred$mean)

```


f) On the same graph, plot the forecast using the three models/methods used in parts b-e. To distinguish different forecast models and methods, choose 'blue' for forecasts generated by regression-based model, 'red' for forecasts by Holt-Winter, 'green' for those generated by ARIMA, and 'purple' for seasonal naive method. Also display the validation data. 
```{r}
plot (train.lm.trend.season.pred, include = 8)
lines(train.hwin.pred$mean, col = 'purple', lwd = 2)
lines(snaive.pred$mean, col = 'green', lwd = 2)
lines(valid.ts, lwd = 2)
```

g) Use accuracy() function to compute forcast accuracy from the three models/methods in parts b-e against the validation set.
```{r}
accuracy(train.lm.trend.season.pred$mean, valid.ts)
accuracy(train.hwin.pred$mean, valid.ts)
accuracy(snaive.pred$mean, valid.ts)
```


h) Which model/method is most accurate from the prediction accuracy standpoint?

Answer: 


i) Let's apply the selected approach to compute the next four quarter for ToyRUs revenues
```{r}

```
