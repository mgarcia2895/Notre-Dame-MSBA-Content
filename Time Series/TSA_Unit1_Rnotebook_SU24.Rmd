This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

How to plot  time series

Read and display data
```{r}
library(readxl)
Amtrak.df <- read_excel("Amtrak data.xls")
head(Amtrak.df) #list out the first 6 observations in the data set
tail(Amtrak.df) # list out the last 6 observations in the data set
head(Amtrak.df,10)#list out the first 10 observations in the data set

```

Let's now convert a data frame Amtrak.df to a time series object
```{r}
#install.packages("forecast")
library(forecast)
Amtrak.ts <- ts(Amtrak.df$Ridership, start=c(1991,1), end = c(2004,3), freq=12)
head(Amtrak.ts)

#Amtrak.ts1 <- ts(Amtrak.df$Ridership, start=c(1991,1), end = c(2004,3), freq=4) #INCORRECT
#head(Amtrak.ts1)
```
Let's visualize the time series together
```{r}
plot(Amtrak.ts)
```
It seems to have a seasonality pattern. We can zoom in to see this pattern a bit clearer.
Let's zoom in to the time from 1991-1992
```{r}
Amtrak.ts.5yrs <- window(Amtrak.ts, start=c(1991,1), end=c(1995,12))
plot(Amtrak.ts.5yrs)
```
Next, we compute the average monthly ridership
```{r}
monthly.Amtrak.ts <- tapply(Amtrak.ts, cycle(Amtrak.ts), mean)
#cycle(Amtrak.ts)
#monthly.Amtrak.ts
plot(monthly.Amtrak.ts, type='l', xaxt='n')
axis(1, at=c(1:12), label = c('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr','May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'))
```

Now, we compute the average ridership yearly
```{r}
annual.Amtrak.ts <- aggregate(Amtrak.ts, FUN =mean)
plot(annual.Amtrak.ts, xaxt='n')
axis(1,at = c(1991:2004))
```




Example: Toy R Us revenue
1.Load the data file "ToysRUsRevenues.xls" to a data frame named 'TRUs.df'. Print out the first few observations
2.Define 'TRUs.ts' as a quarterly time series of TRUs.df. Print out TRUs.ts
3.Use 'ts.apply()' to calculate the average revenue of each quarter through out the years. Name this new series 'Quarterly.TRUs.ts' and plot it out.
4.Use 'aggregate()' function to compute the average revenue for each year (name the new time series annual.TRUS.ts) and draw a time plot to see how the revenue behaves throughout the years.

Solution:

1.Load the data file "ToysRUsRevenues.xls" to a data frame named 'TRUs.df'. Print out the first few observations
```{r}
TRUs.df <- #Fill your code here
head(TRUs.df)

```


2.Define 'TRUs.ts' as a quarterly time series of TRUs.df. Print out TRUs.ts
```{r}
TRUs.ts <- #Fill your codes here
head(TRUs.ts)

```

3.Use 'tapply()' to calculate the average revenue of each quarter through out the years. Name this new series 'Quarterly.TRUs.ts' and plot it out.
```{r}
#Fill your codes here

```

4.Use 'aggregate()' function to compute the average revenue for each year (name the new time series annual.TRUS.ts) and draw a time plot to see how the revenue behaves throughout the years.
```{r}
#Fill your codes here

```
