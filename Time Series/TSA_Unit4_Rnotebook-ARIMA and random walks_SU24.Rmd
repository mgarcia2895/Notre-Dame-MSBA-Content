This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Next, we examine the auto-correlation struture of the ridership.ts
```{r}
Acf(ridership.ts)
```
Let consider y_t is the series of normal random variable
```{r}
y_t <- rnorm(100,0,1) # Generate 100 standard (mean =0 and standard deviation =1) normal random variables
#y_t
Acf(y_t)
```

Let revisit the concept of random walk
y_t = y_{t-1} + e_t
where y_t is the position (value) of the time series at time t
      e_t is the noise (residual) at time t 
      
This implies y_t - y_{t-1} = e_t
and {e_t} is white noise. So, they should have zero auto-correlation

Let's check to see if the ridership.ts is a random walk
```{r}
Acf(diff(ridership.ts,12))
```
Now, we will explore ARIMA model to forecast
```{r}
train.arima <- auto.arima(train.ts)
summary(train.arima)
train.arima.pred <- forecast(train.arima, h=nValid, level=0)
plot(train.arima.pred,include=24)
lines(ets.aaa.pred$mean, col='red', lwd=2)
lines(poly_season_mod_pred$mean, col = 'green', lwd=2)
lines(valid.ts, lwd=2)
```


Compare holt-winter to regression-based model and seasonal naive method
```{r}

#### Figure 18.5
library(forecast)
# run Holt-Winters exponential smoothing
# use ets() with option model = "MAA" to fit Holt-Winter's exponential smoothing 
# with multiplicative error, additive trend, and additive seasonality. 
hwin <- ets(train.ts, model = "MAA")

# create predictions
hwin.pred <- forecast(hwin, h = nValid, level = 0)

# plot the series
plot(hwin.pred, ylim = c(1300, 2600),  ylab = "Ridership", xlab = "Time", 
     bty = "l", xaxt = "n", main = "", flty = 2)
##try to add ', include =nValid + 12' to the end

axis(1, at = seq(1991, 2006, 1), labels = format(seq(1991, 2006, 1)))
#lines(hwin.pred$fitted, lwd = 2, col = "blue")
lines(valid.ts)


# fit regression model with polynomial trend and seasonality
train.lm.trend.season <- tslm(train.ts ~ trend + I(trend^2) + season)
train.lm.trend.season.pred <- forecast(train.lm.trend.season, h= nValid, level = 0)
lines(train.lm.trend.season.pred$mean, col = 'red')

#Revisit seasonal naive
snaive.pred <- snaive(train.ts, h = nValid) #seasonal naive method: an approach that uses the most recent period in the previous
lines(snaive.pred$mean, lwd = 2, col = "blue", lty = 1)

#Check accuracy()
accuracy(hwin.pred$mean,valid.ts)
accuracy(train.lm.trend.season.pred$mean,valid.ts)
accuracy(snaive.pred$mean,valid.ts)
```



```{r}
library(forecast)
library(zoo)
#install.packages('xls')
library(readxl)
Amtrak.data <-read_excel("Amtrak data.xls")
#Amtrak.data <- read.csv("Amtrak data.csv")

ridership.ts <- ts(Amtrak.data$Ridership, start = c(1991, 1), end = c(2004, 3), freq = 12)
ridership.24.ts <- window(ridership.ts, start = c(1991, 1), end = c(1991, 24))

# Figure 7-2
Acf(ridership.24.ts, lag.max = 12, main = "")


```



###Practice Problems####
Problem 17.3 Toys "R" Us Revenues. Figure 17.13 is a time plot of the 
quarterly revenues of Toys "R" Us between 1992 and 1995 (thanks to Chris 
Albright for suggesting the use of these data, which are available in
oysRUsRevenues.csv). 

```{r}
#load the data and create time series object
library(readxl)
tru.data <- read_excel("ToysRUsRevenues.xls")
#tru.data <- read.csv("ToysRUsRevenues.csv")
head(tru.data) #see data
dim(tru.data)
tru.ts <- ts(tru.data[, 2], start = c(1992, 1), end = c(1995, 4), freq = 4)
plot(tru.ts,  ylab = "Revenue ($ millions)", xlab = "Time", bty = "l", 
     xlim = c(1992,1996), ylim = c(0,4500),main = "")

```

a) Partition the data: validation set contains the last four quarters. Use everything else as the training set.  
```{r}
nValid <- 4
nTrain <- length(tru.ts) - nValid
train.ts <-window(tru.ts,start = c(1992,1), end = c(1992,nTrain))
valid.ts <-window(tru.ts,start = c(1992,nTrain+1), end = c(1992,nTrain+nValid))
tail(train.ts)
head(valid.ts)

```

b) Fit a regression model with a linear trend and additive seasonality on the training set. Then find the forecast on the validatio set.
```{r}
library(forecast)
train.lm.trend.season <- #Fill in your codes here
train.lm.trend.season.pred <- #Fill in your codes here
head(train.lm.trend.season.pred$mean)

```


c) Fit a holt-winter method on the training set. Use ets() function to determine the specific argument. Then find the forecasts on the validation set.
```{r}
train.hwin <- #Fill in your codes here
train.hwin.pred <- #Fill in your codes here
```

d) Build an ARIMA model on the training set and find the forecast on the validation set.
```{r}
train.arima <- #Fill your codes here
train.arima.pred <- #Fill your codes here  
```



e) Fit a seasonal naive method on the training set and compute the forecast values on the validtion set.
```{r}
snaive.pred <-#Fill in your codes here
head(snaive.pred$mean)

```


f) On the same graph, plot the forecast using the three models/methods used in parts b-e. To distinguish different forecast models and methods, choose 'blue' for forecasts generated by regression-based model, 'red' for forecasts by Holt-Winter, 'green' for those generated by ARIMA, and 'purple' for seasonal naive method. Also display the validation data. 
```{r}
#Fill your codes here
```

g) Use accuracy() function to compute forcast accuracy from the three models/methods in parts b-e against the validation set.
```{r}
#Fill your codes here

```


h) Which model/method is most accurate from the prediction accuracy standpoint?

Answer: 






BONUS:
Use 'austourists' data from 'fpp' package.
Install and load package 'fpp'
```{r}
#install.packages("fpp")
library(fpp)
plot(austourists)
help("austourists")
#Let's partition the data
head(austourists)
tail(austourists)
```
1. Partition the time series so that there are 12 quarters in the validation data set. Everything prior to that is in the training data. 
```{r}
nValid <- #fill our the rest of the codes here and below
nTrain <-#fill our the rest of the codes here and below
austourists_train <-#fill our the rest of the codes here and below
austourists_valid <-#fill our the rest of the codes here and below
```

2. Let's build ts_reg1 as a regression-based model to capture the seasonality on training  data.
```{r}
ts_reg1 <- #fill our the rest of the codes here and below
summary(ts_reg1)
ts_reg1_pred <- #fill our the rest of the codes here and below
```

3. Let's build ts_reg2 as a regression-based model to capture the trend and seasonality on training  data.
```{r}
#Let's try linear trend and seasonal
ts_reg2 <- #fill our the rest of the codes here and below
summary(ts_reg2)
ts_reg2_pred <- #fill our the rest of the codes here and below
```

4. Let's build ts_reg3 as a regression-based model to capture the exponential trend and seasonality on training  data.
```{r}
#Let's try expontial trend and seasonal
ts_reg3 <- #fill our the rest of the codes here and below
summary(ts_reg3)
ts_reg3_pred <- #fill our the rest of the codes here and below
```

5. Let's build ts_hwin as a Holt-Winter mthod to capture the trend and seasonality on training  data.
```{r}
#Let's try Holt-Winter using ets()
ts_hwin <- #fill our the rest of the codes here and below
summary(ts_hwin)
ts_hwin_pred <- #fill our the rest of the codes here and below
```

6. Build an ARIMA model on training data using auto.arima()
```{r}
#Let's try auto.arima()
ts_arima <-#fill our the rest of the codes here and below
summary(ts_arima)
ts_arima_pred <- #fill our the rest of the codes here and below
```
7. Last but not least, let's consider a benchmark seasonal naive
```{r}
ts_snaive <- #fill our the rest of the codes here and below
```

8. Let's plots all of the forecasts and compare ti the validation data.
```{r}

```


9. Let's check forecast accuracy of all approaches we establisted in parts 2-7.
```{r}


```

10. From parts 8 and 9, what is the most appropriate model/method we should use? Apply that to the entire time series austourists and cimpute the forecast for the next year (four quarters on 2011)
```{r}


```
